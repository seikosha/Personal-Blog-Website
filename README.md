## Personal-Blog-Project

- This is my first homework for the class of front end web development class in Udacity.
- After two rounds review, I made some efforts to make my code correct and clean. Thanks so so much for the two nice reviewers.

## Problems

- I ran my blog-website.html through a HTML5 validator and fixed most of the issues. However, the problem listed blow is really confused me. I would be very happy if you can give me some advices. Why h2-h6 elements is necessary for the 'section' tag?
- >Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.
  >From line 57, column 9; to line 57, column 27
  >↩        <section id="box6">↩
